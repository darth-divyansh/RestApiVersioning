# API Versioning Strategies with Spring Boot

API versioning is a crucial aspect of API design that allows developers to manage changes and updates to their APIs while ensuring backward compatibility. In this project, we explore different strategies for API versioning using Spring Boot.

## URI Based Versioning

In URI-based versioning, the version number is included directly in the URI path.

- **Version 1 (v1):**
  - Endpoint: `/v1/person`
  - Returns: `PersonV1` objects
  - This approach makes the versioning explicit in the URI, providing clear visibility and control over the API version being accessed.

- **Version 2 (v2):**
  - Endpoint: `/v2/person`
  - Returns: `PersonV2` objects
  - Allows for separate implementations of different versions of the API, making it easier to maintain and evolve each version independently.

## Request Parameter Versioning

Request parameter versioning involves specifying the version number as a query parameter in the request URL.

- **Version 1 (version=1):**
  - Endpoint: `/person?version=1`
  - Returns: `PersonV1` objects
  - Provides a simple and flexible approach where clients can specify the desired version through request parameters.

- **Version 2 (version=2):**
  - Endpoint: `/person?version=2`
  - Returns: `PersonV2` objects
  - Allows for backward compatibility as clients can continue using the older version or migrate to newer versions as needed.

## Custom Header Versioning

Custom header versioning involves specifying the version number as a custom header in the HTTP request.

- **Version 1 (X-API-VERSION=1):**
  - Endpoint: `/person`
  - Header: `X-API-VERSION: 1`
  - Returns: `PersonV1` objects
  - Offers a clean separation of concerns by keeping versioning information in request headers, making the URI paths cleaner and less cluttered.

- **Version 2 (X-API-VERSION=2):**
  - Endpoint: `/person`
  - Header: `X-API-VERSION: 2`
  - Returns: `PersonV2` objects
  - Allows for more granular control over versioning and simplifies the URI structure, enhancing readability and maintainability.

## Media Type Versioning

Media type versioning, also known as content negotiation, involves specifying the version number in the `Accept` header of the HTTP request.

- **Version 1 (application/person.v1+json):**
  - Endpoint: `/person`
  - Accept Header: `application/person.v1+json`
  - Returns: `PersonV1` objects
  - Enables clients to explicitly request a specific version of the API by specifying the desired media type in the request header.

- **Version 2 (application/person.v2+json):**
  - Endpoint: `/person`
  - Accept Header: `application/person.v2+json`
  - Returns: `PersonV2` objects
  - Facilitates seamless versioning without cluttering the URI, promoting clean and concise resource URLs.

## Conclusion

Each versioning strategy offers its own set of advantages and considerations, and the choice of approach depends on factors such as project requirements, client preferences, and compatibility concerns. By understanding and implementing these versioning strategies, developers can effectively manage API evolution and ensure a smooth and consistent experience for API consumers.
